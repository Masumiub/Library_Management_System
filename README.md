# Library_Management_System
Implement a library management program using linked list. The program stores the following information of a book: 
1. Name 2. Author 3. Status (available/borrowed) 4. Popularity (calculated based on the number of times a book is borrowed) 
Whenever new books arrive, those are arranged alphabetically. The librarian can perform the following activities: 
1. View list of all (both available or borrowed) books  2. View list of available books 3. Add new book 4. Delete a book if it is lost 5. Check the availability of a particular book 6. Changing the status of a book when a user borrows/returns it 7. Find the most popular book and recommend it to users
